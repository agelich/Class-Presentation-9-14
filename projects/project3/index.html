    <h5>titled ‘in love with the world,’ the commission is created by anicka yi in partnership with hyundai motor and will show from october 12th, 2021 — january 16th, 2022.</h5>
    <p align="justify">Work by artist anicka yi which transforms the museum’s turbine hall with a new ecosystem. in celebration of the heritage of the space, which had once housed the bankside power station tubines, the artwork populates the hall with machines once more — this time, they are pneumatic. dubbed ‘aerobes,’ the inflatable, floating machines propose a new type of industrial vision, a blend of technology and biology. the work speculates on the possibility of machines evolving into independent life forms. Recalling the biological forms of fungi, or ocean life forms, the floating machines recall the ranging levels of complexity among organisms within an ecosystem. inspired by the diverse ways in which organisms learn through their bodies and senses, the artist proposes the work to imagine a new type of artificial intelligence. With ‘in love with the world,’ anicka yi integrates her interest in scent and air. the artist has long explored the politics of air, and it’s been impacted by changing attitudes, inequalities, and ecological awareness. with this in mind, the artist makes use of scent as a medium to give a presence to air, which we all share and on which we all depend.</p>

     <p align="justify"> CONCEPT of "Socio-Air" (Biomorphic INFLATABLES)</p>

 

<p align="justify"> This project proposes a new strategy of technical vision, blending fan (technological power) and biology (the effect of breathing). The work speculates on the opportunity to simulate biological breathing through the equipment power - simply speaking to inflate the form using the natural rhythm of breathing set up through the mobile application. The shape of inflatables will be modified through the natural breathing rhythm. Different rhythms of breathing can be set - for example, during the night, breathing will have another pattern than daily sport activity. These experiments will help us understand better how to infuse natural life with artificial objects to form biomorphic artificial intelligence. This can later be used in different industrial applications where gentle touch of nature has to be considered, including group behaviour as the response to different situations. When we are stressed, for instance, our breathing changes and the amount of air which transforms inflatables and environment is changed already. We can create multiple inflatables which represent different breathing patterns and explore how they influenced each other or how all together they change the ecosystem and physical environment.   For example, in the precedent (<a href="https://www.designboom.com/art/anicka-yi-tate-modern-hyundai-motor-london-floating-machines-aerobes-10-11-2021/">https://www.designboom.com/art/anicka-yi-tate-modern-hyundai-motor-london-floating-machines-aerobes-10-11-2021/</a>)  species (inflatables exhibit individual and group behaviors in response to different environmental factors) "recalling the biological forms of fungi, or ocean life forms, the floating machines recall the ranging levels of complexity among organisms within an ecosystem. inspired by the diverse ways in which organisms learn through their bodies and senses, the artist proposes the work to imagine a new type of artificial intelligence. "

 

Applications- Using simple inflatables and modifying their shapes with the breathing pattern of a fan, we can see how the physical space is getting changed when the breathing is calm or during stress. We can explore the different levels of these changes and even predict how space will be modified during different social events. For example, if the level of excitement of music festival's participants are close to the explosion of the inflatable form, there will be a way to predict how much space should be designated for different social events including festivals, music events, meetings etc. - to simulate the space response to the biological breathing. </p>
