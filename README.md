<h1>MOTION
A flywheel is a mechanical device which uses the conservation of angu
-
lar momentum to store rotational energy. Since a flywheel serves to store
mechanical energy for later use, it is natural to consider it as a kinetic
energy analogue of an electrical inductor. Once suitably abstracted,
this shared principle of energy storage is described in the generalized
concept of an accumulator. More precisely, a flywheel's stored energy
will donate a surge in power output upon a drop in power input and will
conversely absorb any excess power input (system-generated power) in
the form of rotational energy.Flywheels are often used to provide contin
-
uous power output in systems where the energy source is not continuous.
To activate the car we need to push it giving wheels a spin by dragging
them on a surface. When the car is pushed the inertia of the flywheel
keeps it rolling smoothly. Flywheel spins around giving the output.</h>
