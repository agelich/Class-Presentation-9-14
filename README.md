<h1>Assembly Sequence of Flywheel Car
Flywheel Car Toy Assembly sequence can be divided into 4 sections (A,B,C,D). Every sections 
includes up to 5 assembling components which interwined between each other. Some components are much more connected with each other and depends on each other than others. Assembling the toy car starts from A and B sections which represents the Core of the car mechanism. It represents inner part of the body mechanism. It consists of the Core Rod, Wheel Weights, 
Core Gears, Core Spacer, Core Spring (A1,A2,A3,A4, A5) and B1, B2, B3, B4. This section has to 
be assembled first and it was disambeled the last. The section B consists of Wheel Base Shell- B1, 
Wheel Gears- 2 identical parts (B2), Shaft- 2 identical pieces (B4). Car has 4 solid wheels -C1 
connected to C2 and shafts B4. The A section has to be assembled first, then B section, C section and finally the innner and outer car Shells from D section which are tied by 4 screws. Component D 1 tied with B section by 1 screw. The screws are needed to keep these parts stable. It 
locks B section firmly completing the core mechanism design. It is a reason why wheels are 
belongs to the different section, they also present the different function. The architecture of the 
car starts from the inside to outside collecting the inner sections first. If section A,B is assemble 
incorrectly the car will not move. It is important to remeber that the movement can be performed only along X axis. One way to ensure that the car achives KCs is to follow the logic to 
assemble components from inside to outside and to tie them properly, especially A,B sections.-
For example, components D5 play less important role in car operation than components of 
A,B,C sections</h>
